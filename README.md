      Good evening, <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this Github Repo will house all of my study notes for the SICP as well as my own solutions to all the exercises provided. On 1st of November 2025, I begun my journey of studying the SICP and I intend to complete the book within a year. I decided that I would write my notes first on paper and then I would export them in digital form here. <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>The notes here will be focusing on language-agnostic concepts, and not basic programming syntax learnt through Scheme. This is because it is easy to learn a programming language and its rules, but difficult to learn the underlying concepts behind it, therefore, I will be focusing on that.</li><br>
        <li>The exercise solutions are not necessarily the most efficient, or even the best algorithm possible, but instead the solutions are from what I have comprehended from the book's content.</li><br>
      </ul>
      I believe that I must say that none of the notes or solutions are made by AI. They are from my own understanding, any solutions I couldn't grasp, would be googled, understood, then rewritten in my own way. <br><br>

### Why this book?

The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (<i>or SICP for short</i>) is known worldwide as one of the best books to learn programming and its concepts. It is written by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. It focuses on the foundations of computer science and software development. It is also a part of the `teachyourselfcs.com` curriculum.

### Scheme

I have used the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) version of Scheme, which means you may find that I do not explicitly "display" all of the values, this is because in the Racket version of Scheme, it already displays any value evaluated. I believe the Racket version is the closest one to the version used in the book, that I could easily download. I used VSCode as my IDE, instead of DrRacket.
